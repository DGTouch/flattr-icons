Before submitting icons, make sure to read the guidelines in the folder *flattr-guidelines* and use the proper template for the icon you wish to do using the files in the folder **flattr-templates**.

You will need Inkscape to modify the SVG files, we reocmmend you use the latest version possible as the stable one might add unnecessary data to the files.
